# Next.js 15 Hydration Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon hydration mismatch error that can occur in Next.js 15 applications.  The error is caused by a mismatch between the client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR) of a page.  Specifically, if the page content changes before data is fetched, this will trigger the error.

## Bug Description

A hydration mismatch error occurs when the client-side rendered HTML differs from the server-side rendered HTML. This typically happens when the client and server produce different values. In this case, it arises because the client attempts to hydrate a page with content that's different from the server-side content.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Observe the hydration mismatch error in your browser's console.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the data is fetched before the content is rendered on the client-side. This can be achieved using various techniques such as:

- Using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` to fetch data during server-side rendering.
- Using a loading indicator to prevent the user from seeing the mismatch.
- Using client-side data fetching techniques to fetch data and update the content after the initial rendering.
